## About the Project

This all started with a strange contrast that stuck in my head—how something meant to cause damage, like malware or a virus, could be twisted into something visually stunning. There's something wild and poetic about that. It made me wonder: if we can turn digital chaos into beauty, what else could we reimagine?


Then came the idea. What if we took real stories from the world—raw, emotional, unpredictable headlines—and gave them a second life? What if an AI could see those stories not as news, but as inspiration for art?

This project is my way of exploring that question. It’s part curiosity, part creativity, and part learning experience. I wanted a space to understand AI better, especially how language and prompts shape what it creates. But I also wanted to build something that reacts to the world in real time—transforming words into visuals, data into feelings.

At its core, this is a deeply personal experiment. It's about using technology to make something unexpected, maybe even meaningful, out of the everyday noise.

## How It Works

Every day, at a set time, a quiet little process begins in the background—like a digital muse waking up for its morning routine.

It starts by reaching out to a news API, gathering a list of current headlines from across the internet. From there, the system gets a bit choosy: it filters out stories with keywords that don’t suit the project (the too dark, too dull, or simply not-right-for-now). The goal is to find stories that *spark something visual.*

Once filtered, each story is passed through a set of AI models—language-based systems trained to score the stories based on a few secret criteria. The rules are my own, designed to pick out emotion, originality, and visual storytelling potential. Each model gives a score between 1 and 20, and the top-scoring story of the day wins.

That chosen story is then passed into a different kind of AI—one that specializes in turning words into pictures. Using the story’s key themes and tone, it helps craft an image prompt. The exact visual style is still evolving (and honestly, that part's half the fun), but the prompt is designed to bring the heart of the story to life in visual form.
